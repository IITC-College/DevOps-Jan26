                            LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 2
                    "Group Execute Permissions" - Team Scripts
================================================================================

Welcome to Exercise 2!

Sometimes you want team members (group) to be able to run a script, but not
everyone. That's where `chmod g+x` comes in.

EXERCISE:
---------
Learn to add execute permission to the group so team members can run scripts.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Navigate to the scripts/broken directory:
   cd ../../scripts/broken

2. Check permissions of team_script.sh:
   ls -l team_script.sh

3. Notice the current permissions (should be -rw-rw-r--)

4. Add execute permission to the GROUP:
   chmod g+x team_script.sh

5. Check permissions again:
   ls -l team_script.sh

6. Notice that the group (middle 3 characters) now has 'x'

7. Try running the script:
   ./team_script.sh
   (As a normal user you may still see "Permission denied" because only the
   group got execute—you are "others". The point is that the group now has x.
   To see the script run, you can use: bash team_script.sh)

8. Also check shared_tool.sh and fix it:
   ls -l shared_tool.sh
   chmod g+x shared_tool.sh
   ./shared_tool.sh (or bash shared_tool.sh if you see Permission denied)

COMMANDS TO USE:
----------------
- ls -l team_script.sh
- chmod g+x team_script.sh
- ls -l team_script.sh (verify)
- ./team_script.sh
- chmod g+x shared_tool.sh
- ./shared_tool.sh

UNDERSTANDING:
-------------
- `chmod g+x` = Add execute permission to GROUP only
- This allows group members to run the script
- Others (non-group members) still cannot run it

COMPARISON:
-----------
Before: -rw-rw-r-- (group: rw, no execute)
After:  -rw-rwxr-- (group: rwx, has execute)

Group members can now run this script!

WRITE YOUR ANSWER:
------------------
After completing the exercise, write in my_answers.txt (in the main lab directory):
- What were the permissions of team_script.sh before chmod g+x?
- What were the permissions after chmod g+x?
- What is the difference between 'chmod g+x' and 'chmod u+x'?
- When would you use 'chmod g+x'?
